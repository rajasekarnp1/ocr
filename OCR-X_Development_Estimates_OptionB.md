**Disclaimer:** These are rough, high-level estimates for an initial functional version. Actual effort can vary significantly based on team expertise, specific implementation choices, unforeseen challenges, and the desired level of polish and robustness for each component. The R&D nature of the "Simulated Quantum Error Correction" makes its estimate particularly speculative. These estimates assume a small, focused team.Okay, I have created the `OCR-X_Development_Estimates_OptionB.md` file with the detailed development estimates.

The file includes:

1.  **Core OCR Pipeline Components:**
    *   Estimates for each sub-component of the Input Handling & Preprocessing Module, Recognition Module (Ensemble Engine), and Post-Processing Module.
    *   Each entry has Complexity Assessment, Estimated Story Points, Estimated Person-Hours, and Assumptions & Notes.

2.  **Application & Utility Components:**
    *   Estimates for the Windows Client Application (UI, Workflow Orchestrator, Configuration Manager).
    *   Estimates for the Synthetic Data Generation Pipeline.
    *   Estimates for the initial setup of the Model Management & Retraining Framework.

3.  **Project Management & Overhead:**
    *   General estimates for Detailed Planning, Testing (Integration & E2E), Documentation, and basic CI/CD Setup.

4.  **Summary Table:**
    *   A table summarizing total Story Points and Person-Hours for Core OCR Pipeline, Application & Utilities, Project Management & Overhead, and a Grand Total for the initial version of Option B.

The estimates provided aim to be realistic for an initial functional version, considering the complexity of Windows integration with DirectML and the R&D nature of some components.
