# OCR-X Project: Security Implementation Plan (Option B - Flexible Hybrid Powerhouse)

This document details the security measures for the OCR-X project (Option B: Flexible Hybrid Powerhouse), focusing on protecting user data, API keys, and ensuring secure operation of the desktop application.

## I. Core Security Principles

The security implementation for OCR-X is guided by the following core principles:

*   **Least Privilege:** Application processes will run with the minimum necessary permissions. The application will not require administrative privileges for its core OCR functionalities. Access to resources like the file system and network will be requested only as needed.
*   **Defense in Depth:** Multiple layers of security controls will be implemented. For example, secure API key storage combined with HTTPS for transit and input validation forms multiple barriers.
*   **Secure by Default:** Default configurations for the application will prioritize security. For instance, cloud API features requiring user-provided keys will be disabled by default until explicitly configured by the user.
*   **Data Minimization:** The application will collect and store only essential user data. For Option B, this primarily means user-provided API keys and application configuration settings. Processed document content is handled transiently unless explicitly saved by the user.

## II. Authentication and Authorization (Primarily for Cloud API Usage)

This section focuses on how OCR-X handles credentials for accessing external cloud OCR services.

*   **API Key Management (User-Provided Keys for Google/Azure):**
    *   **Secure Storage:**
        *   **Primary Method:** Leverage the Windows Credential Manager API to store and retrieve user-provided API keys for Google Cloud Vision and Azure AI Vision. This will be accessed via Python's `keyring` library (or direct `ctypes`/`pywin32` calls if `keyring` has limitations in the packaged environment, though `keyring` is preferred). This method ensures keys are encrypted based on the user's Windows login credentials, providing strong protection at rest.
        *   **Alternative (Fallback, if Credential Manager access proves problematic in specific user environments):** An encrypted local configuration file. If this method is used, the encryption key will be derived using a strong key derivation function (KDF) from a user-provided master password (managed solely by the user and not stored by the application). Python's `cryptography` library (e.g., Fernet symmetric encryption with AES) will be used for this. This is less ideal due to the burden of master password management on the user.
    *   **User Input:** API keys will be entered through dedicated input fields in the application's settings UI. These fields will mask the input (e.g., display as asterisks).
    *   **In-Memory Handling:**
        *   API keys will be loaded into memory only when an API call is about to be made.
        *   Variables holding API keys will be cleared from memory as soon as practically possible after the API call concludes (e.g., by setting the variable to `None` and ensuring no other references exist, relying on Python's garbage collection).
        *   **API keys will never be logged**, even at DEBUG level. Placeholder messages (e.g., "API Key loaded from store") will be used in logs instead.
*   **Application-Level Access Control (If applicable in future for shared features):**
    *   For the current scope of Option B (Flexible Hybrid Powerhouse) as a primarily local desktop application using user-provided cloud API keys, no centralized application-level authentication or authorization is required for the core OCR functionality.
    *   If future enhancements involve OCR-X managing shared resources or its own cloud storage/services on behalf of users, then proper user authentication (e.g., OAuth 2.0 with a dedicated backend identity provider) and authorization mechanisms would need to be designed and implemented. This is out of scope for the initial version.

## III. Data Encryption

This section details encryption for data at rest and in transit.

*   **API Keys:**
    *   **At Rest:** As described above, primarily handled by Windows Credential Manager which encrypts data based on user credentials. If the alternative file-based encryption is used, AES-256 (or similar strong cipher via `cryptography` library) will be employed.
*   **Local Configuration Files (Non-sensitive settings):**
    *   General application settings (e.g., UI preferences, default local engine choice, paths to non-sensitive resources) stored in `config.yaml` will typically not be encrypted, as they do not contain secrets.
    *   If any future configuration setting is deemed sensitive but not suitable for Credential Manager, field-level encryption using `cryptography` would be applied.
*   **Temporary Files:**
    *   Temporary files (e.g., intermediate images from preprocessing steps, raw text output before post-processing) will be created in a secure, user-specific temporary directory obtained via `tempfile.gettempdir()` or a subdirectory within `%APPDATA%\OCR-X\temp`.
    *   Python's `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile` with `delete=True` (default) or manual `os.remove()` in `finally` blocks will be used to ensure temporary files are deleted as soon as they are no longer needed or upon application exit/error.
    *   Permissions on these temporary files will be set to be user-specific by default by the OS.
*   **Data in Transit (to Cloud OCR APIs):**
    *   All communication with Google Cloud Vision API and Azure AI Vision API **must** use HTTPS.
    *   The official Python SDKs (`google-cloud-vision`, `azure-ai-vision-imageanalysis`/`azure-ai-formrecognizer`) handle this by default. This will be verified during development and testing.
    *   No custom HTTP calls will be made to these APIs; only SDK-provided methods will be used.

## IV. Windows Application Security (Client-Side)

Measures to secure the OCR-X desktop application itself.

*   **Code Signing:**
    *   The final MSIX installer package for OCR-X **must be digitally signed** using a valid Authenticode code signing certificate obtained from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).
    *   This ensures authenticity (verifies the publisher) and integrity (ensures the package hasn't been tampered with since signing).
    *   The CI/CD pipeline will include a step for automated code signing using `signtool.exe` (as outlined in `OCR-X_Infrastructure_as_Code.md`).
*   **Input Validation:**
    *   **File Paths:** All file paths provided by the user (for input images/PDFs or output locations) will be validated and sanitized to prevent directory traversal attacks (e.g., by normalizing paths using `os.path.normpath` and ensuring they are within expected base directories if applicable).
    *   **Configuration Settings:** Values entered by users in configuration UIs (e.g., for thresholds, engine parameters) will be validated for type and range to prevent errors or unexpected behavior.
    *   **Image File Parsing:**
        *   Image files will be parsed using well-maintained Python libraries (e.g., Pillow, OpenCV). These libraries will be kept up-to-date to include fixes for known parsing vulnerabilities.
        *   The application will attempt to catch exceptions during image parsing to handle malformed or malicious image files gracefully, preventing crashes.
*   **Dependency Management:**
    *   Python dependencies will be regularly scanned for known vulnerabilities using tools like `Safety` or `pip-audit` integrated into the CI/CD pipeline (as defined in `OCR-X_Quality_Gates.md`).
    *   Vulnerable packages will be updated promptly, considering compatibility. A process for reviewing and addressing reported vulnerabilities in dependencies will be established.
*   **ONNX Model Security:**
    *   ONNX models for local processing (geometric correction, PaddleOCR, SVTR, ByT5) will be sourced from official or trusted repositories.
    *   Checksums (e.g., SHA256) of the models will be verified after download (if downloaded dynamically) or before packaging to ensure integrity.
    *   The ONNX Runtime library will be kept up-to-date to mitigate any potential vulnerabilities in model parsing or execution.
*   **Safe File Handling:**
    *   The application will use standard OS APIs for file operations, which respect user permissions.
    *   It will primarily write to user-designated output directories or its application-specific data folders (e.g., `%APPDATA%\OCR-X`).
    *   Care will be taken to avoid creating or modifying files in system directories or other protected locations.
*   **Error Handling:**
    *   Robust `try-except` blocks will be used for operations prone to failure (file I/O, network requests, model inference).
    *   Error messages displayed to the user will be informative but avoid revealing sensitive system details or stack traces. Detailed error information will be logged for debugging.

## V. Network Security (for Cloud API Communication)

*   **HTTPS Exclusively:** All communication with Google Cloud Vision API and Azure AI Vision API will be over HTTPS. The respective SDKs manage this.
*   **Firewall Compatibility:**
    *   Documentation will advise users that OCR-X requires outbound internet access on port 443 (standard HTTPS) for its cloud OCR features to function.
    *   The application will attempt to provide user-friendly error messages if cloud API calls fail due to network connectivity issues, suggesting firewall configuration checks.
*   **No Direct Listening Ports:**
    *   The OCR-X desktop application (Option B) will not open any listening network ports. It acts purely as a client.
    *   If future features require local inter-process communication, named pipes or loopback-restricted sockets might be considered, with appropriate security measures.

## VI. Secure Development Lifecycle (SDL) Practices

*   **Code Reviews:** Mandatory code reviews for all changes, with a focus on security implications (as per `OCR-X_Quality_Gates.md`).
*   **Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST):** Use of `Bandit` in the CI/CD pipeline to identify potential security flaws in Python code.
*   **Secrets Scanning:** Use of `detect-secrets` and/or GitHub's native secret scanning to prevent accidental commitment of credentials.
*   **Dependency Vulnerability Management:** Regular scanning and updating of third-party libraries.
*   **Security Awareness:** Encourage ongoing security awareness for developers (e.g., common vulnerabilities like OWASP Top 10 for web, though desktop apps have different threat models, principles of secure coding remain relevant).
*   **Threat Modeling (Conceptual):** For major new features, especially those involving new external communications or sensitive data handling, a lightweight threat modeling exercise will be considered to identify potential attack vectors and necessary mitigations. This will be detailed further if specific features warrant it.
*   **Incident Response:** Follow the `OCR-X_Failure_Response_Protocol.md` for handling security incidents, including vulnerability disclosure and patching.

This security implementation plan provides a foundation for building and maintaining a secure OCR-X application for end-users. It will be reviewed and updated as the project evolves.The `OCR-X_Security_Implementation.md` file has been created successfully.
