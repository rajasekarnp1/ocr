# OCR-X Project: Phased Development Plan (Option B - Flexible Hybrid Powerhouse)

This document outlines a phased development plan for the OCR-X project, based on the selected architecture: Option B - Flexible Hybrid Powerhouse.

## I. Overall Phasing Strategy

The development of OCR-X will follow an iterative and incremental approach. The initial focus will be on delivering a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that establishes the core OCR pipeline and validates the key architectural decisions of Option B, which combines local DirectML accelerated engines with the ability to switch to leading commercial cloud OCR APIs. Subsequent phases will build upon the MVP, incrementally adding features, enhancing performance and accuracy, and refining the user experience based on feedback and evolving requirements. This strategy allows for early validation, risk mitigation, and a flexible response to development challenges and opportunities.

## II. Phase 1: Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

*   **Goal:** Deliver a functional core OCR system for Windows that allows selection between a local DirectML-accelerated open-source engine and at least one commercial cloud OCR API, achieves high accuracy on common machine-printed documents, and demonstrates key architectural components of Option B.
*   **Core Features (MoSCoW Prioritization for MVP):**
    *   **Must Have:**
        *   **Input Handling:**
            *   Support for common image formats (JPG, PNG).
            *   Support for single-page image extraction from PDF files.

            *   OCR Engine Abstraction Layer: Initial version to support switching between different OCR engine implementations.
            *   Integration of a single, robust open-source engine: PaddleOCR PP-OCRv4 (detection + recognition models for English).
            *   Integration of one commercial cloud OCR API (e.g., Google Document AI or Azure AI Vision) via the abstraction layer.
            *   Basic API Key Management: Securely load API key for the selected cloud service from a configuration file or environment variable for the MVP.
            *   ONNX conversion of the selected *local* engine's models (e.g., PaddleOCR).
