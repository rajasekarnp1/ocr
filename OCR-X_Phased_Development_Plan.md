# OCR-X Project: Phased Development Plan (Option B - On-Premise Powerhouse)

This document outlines a phased development plan for the OCR-X project, based on the selected architecture: Option B - On-Premise Powerhouse.

## I. Overall Phasing Strategy

The development of OCR-X will follow an iterative and incremental approach. The initial focus will be on delivering a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that establishes the core OCR pipeline and validates the key architectural decisions of Option B. Subsequent phases will build upon the MVP, incrementally adding features, enhancing performance and accuracy, and refining the user experience based on feedback and evolving requirements. This strategy allows for early validation, risk mitigation, and a flexible response to development challenges and opportunities.

## II. Phase 1: Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
