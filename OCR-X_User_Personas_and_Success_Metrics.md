## Success Metrics

The following metrics will be used to evaluate the success of the OCR-X project, aligning with its goal of achieving near-100% accuracy for machine-printed text and other key requirements.

### 1. Accuracy Benchmarks

*   **Target Character Error Rate (CER):**
    *   `<1%` on standard machine-printed English documents (e.g., ICDAR 2003, 2013, 2019 benchmark datasets for printed text).
    *   `<2%` on documents with common fonts but moderate noise or slightly complex layouts.
*   **Target Word Error Rate (WER):**
    *   `<2%` on standard machine-printed English documents (e.g., ICDAR benchmarks).
    *   `<4%` on documents with common fonts and moderate noise/complexity.
*   **Benchmark Datasets:** Performance will be rigorously tested on established academic benchmarks (e.g., ICDAR series, UW-III, etc.) and a custom-curated dataset representing target use cases (e.g., historical texts, legal documents, logistics forms).

### 2. Processing Speed

*   **Target Processing Speed (Standard Hardware):**
    *   **Single Core CPU:** At least 20-30 pages per minute (PPM) for a standard A4 document at 300 DPI. (Specific CPU baseline to be defined, e.g., Intel Core i5/i7, recent generation).

*   **Noise Resilience:** Achieve CER `<3%` and WER `<5%` on documents with moderate simulated noise (e.g., Gaussian noise, salt-and-pepper noise) or common scanning artifacts (e.g., slight skew <5 degrees, minor illumination variations).
*   **Complex Layouts:**
    *   Successfully segment and order text from documents with at least two columns with >95% accuracy in block segmentation and ordering.
    *   Basic table detection and correct reading order of cells (initial focus, advanced table structure recognition as a stretch goal).
*   **Platform Compatibility:**
    *   Primary target: Windows 10/11 (64-bit).
    *   Secondary target (if resources allow): Cross-platform compatibility for the core engine (e.g., via .NET Core or Python bindings on Linux).

### 7. Qualitative Goals

*   **User Satisfaction (Beta Testers/Early Adopters):** Achieve a high satisfaction rating (e.g., >80% positive feedback) regarding accuracy, speed, and ease of use from a selected group of beta testers representing the target personas.
*   **Community & Documentation:** If open-sourced or offering a free tier, foster an active community and maintain comprehensive, up-to-date documentation.

These personas and metrics will guide the development and prioritization of features for the OCR-X project. They will be reviewed and updated as the project progresses and more insights are gained.
