# This file makes 'ocrx.modules.engines' a Python package.

# Optionally, you can expose engine classes here for easier import, e.g.:
# from .paddleocr_engine import PaddleOCREngineWrapper
# from .another_engine import AnotherEngineWrapper

# Or define a factory function to get engine instances by name/config.

# For now, keeping it simple. Specific engine wrappers will be imported directly
# by the RecognitionCoreManager based on configuration.
