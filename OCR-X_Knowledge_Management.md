    *   The Contribution Guidelines and Build/Deployment Guide are kept current with any process or tooling changes.

### C. API Documentation

*   **Applicability to Option B:** For the current scope of Option B as a desktop application, it does not expose external APIs for third-party consumption.
*   **Internal APIs:** Interfaces between internal modules are documented via docstrings and the component design documents.
*   **Future Scope:** If OCR-X were to evolve to include a local server component or web API (e.g., for batch processing management or remote job submission), standard API documentation tools like **FastAPI's automatic Swagger/OpenAPI generation** or standalone **Swagger Editor/OpenAPI Generator** would be used. This section would then be expanded significantly.

### D. Project Decision Log

*   **Purpose:** To capture the rationale behind significant architectural, technical, and strategic decisions made during the project.
*   **Content:**
    *   Date of decision.
    *   Decision made.
    *   Problem/Issue addressed.
    *   Alternatives considered.
    *   Rationale for the chosen solution (linking to relevant documents like `OCR-X_Decision_Matrix.md`, `OCR-X_Risk_Assessment.md`, PoC results, etc.).
    *   Key stakeholders involved or consulted.
    *   Expected outcomes or consequences.
*   **Format:** A dedicated section or page(s) in the project's central Wiki (e.g., GitHub Wiki, Confluence). Each decision can be a separate entry or sub-page.
*   **Maintenance:** Updated by the project lead or relevant team members whenever a key decision is finalized. Reviewed periodically to ensure continued relevance.

## III. Team Onboarding Procedures

*   **Onboarding Kit (Digital):** A curated collection of resources for new developers and QA engineers.
    *   **Checklist:**
        *   Access to Git repository (and Git LFS setup instructions).
        *   Access to the issue tracker (e.g., GitHub Issues, Jira).
        *   Access to communication channels (e.g., Slack, Microsoft Teams).
        *   Introduction to the project's documentation structure and key documents.
    *   **Core Documentation Links:**
        *   `OCR-X_Requirements_Specification.md`
        *   `OCR-X_Architectural_Variants.md` (focus on Option B)
        *   `OCR-X_Component_Breakdown_OptionB.md`
        *   `OCR-X_Development_Environment.md` (setup guide)
        *   Contribution Guidelines (from Developer Documentation).
    *   **Initial Tasks:** Assign "good first issues" (well-defined, smaller tasks with clear acceptance criteria) to help new members get familiar with the codebase, tools, and development process.
*   **Mentorship:** Assign an experienced team member as a mentor or "buddy" to each new joiner for the first few weeks to answer questions, provide guidance, and facilitate integration into the team.
*   **Knowledge Sharing Sessions:**
    *   **Regular Internal Tech Talks/Demos:** Bi-weekly or monthly sessions where team members can:
        *   Demo new features they've developed.
        *   Explain complex components or recent refactoring efforts.
        *   Share learnings from new technologies or tools evaluated.
        *   Discuss challenging bugs and their solutions.
    *   **Documentation Reviews:** Periodically review key documentation in team meetings to ensure it's up-to-date and understood.

## IV. Incident Response Playbooks & Post-Mortems

*   **Building on `OCR-X_Failure_Response_Protocol.md`:** This KM section focuses on the creation, storage, and dissemination of knowledge derived from incidents.
*   **Playbooks (Runbooks):**
    *   For common or high-impact failure scenarios identified in the Failure Response Protocol (S1/S2 incidents), develop concise, step-by-step playbooks.
    *   **Examples:**
        *   "Playbook: Local OCR Engine Accuracy Degradation" (Diagnostic steps, model rollback, cache clearing).
        *   "Playbook: Cloud API Authentication Failures (User Side)" (Checking API key validity, quota issues, common SDK errors).
        *   "Playbook: High Resource Usage by OCR-X Application" (Using Task Manager/Performance Monitor, identifying culprit processes/threads, log analysis).
        *   "Playbook: MSIX Installation/Update Failures" (Common Windows installer error codes, log locations).
    *   **Content:** Each playbook should include: Symptoms, Potential Causes, Diagnostic Steps (including specific commands or UI actions), Escalation Points (if applicable), Recovery Procedures, and links to relevant detailed documentation.
*   **Post-Mortem Process & Knowledge Base:**
    *   **Process:** Follow the blameless post-mortem process defined in `OCR-X_Failure_Response_Protocol.md`.
    *   **Template:** Use a standardized template for post-mortem reports (including sections for timeline, impact, root cause, what went well, what could be improved, and action items).
    *   **Storage:** Store playbooks and post-mortem summaries in a centralized, easily searchable, and version-controlled knowledge base. This could be:
        *   A dedicated section in the project's Wiki (e.g., GitHub Wiki, Confluence).
        *   A structured directory within the `/docs` folder of the Git repository (Markdown files).
    *   **Dissemination:** Summarize key learnings from post-mortems and share them during team meetings or knowledge-sharing sessions to prevent recurrence.
    *   **Action Item Tracking:** Ensure all action items from post-mortems are logged in the issue tracker and prioritized for implementation.

## V. Tools for Knowledge Management

*   **Version Control System:** **Git** (with **Git LFS** for large binary files like ONNX models and test datasets) is the primary store for all code, documentation-as-code (Markdown, reStructuredText), IaC scripts, and configuration templates. Hosted on platforms like GitHub or Azure DevOps Repos.
*   **Wiki/Collaboration Platform:**
    *   **GitHub Wiki:** Suitable for project decision logs, meeting notes, quick guides, and collaborative drafting of some documentation.
    *   **Confluence / SharePoint (if available within the organization):** Offer more structured knowledge base features, better for larger teams or more formal documentation needs.
*   **Issue Tracker:** **GitHub Issues**, Jira, or a similar tool for tracking bugs, features, tasks (including documentation and technical debt tasks), and action items from post-mortems.
*   **Documentation Generation:**
    *   **Sphinx:** For generating HTML (and PDF) documentation from Python docstrings and reStructuredText/Markdown.
    *   **MkDocs / Docsify / ReadTheDocs:** Alternatives for generating documentation from Markdown files, often simpler for pure Markdown projects. ReadTheDocs can host Sphinx-generated documentation.
*   **Shared Drive/Cloud Storage (e.g., OneDrive, Google Drive, SharePoint Document Libraries):** For storing very large files not suitable for Git LFS (e.g., raw, multi-gigabyte datasets before curation), presentations, or other project artifacts that don't fit well into Git. Link to these from the primary KM platform.
*   **Communication Tools:** Slack, Microsoft Teams for day-to-day discussions, quick knowledge sharing, and notifications from CI/CD or monitoring systems.

By implementing this Knowledge Management strategy, the OCR-X project aims to build a sustainable and well-documented system, fostering a culture of continuous learning and improvement.The `OCR-X_Knowledge_Management.md` file has been created successfully.
