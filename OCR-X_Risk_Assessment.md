## 3. Risk: Accuracy Limitations of SOTA Open Source Models

*   **Description:** Despite using an ensemble of SOTA open-source models (PP-OCRv4, SVTR) and fine-tuning, the system (Option B) may not consistently achieve the ambitious target accuracy (CER <0.5%, WER <1.0% as per FR1) on all document types, especially very challenging or out-of-distribution inputs.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Moderate (Failure to meet some accuracy targets, reduced user trust for critical applications, need for more extensive post-processing or manual correction)
*   **Overall Risk Level:** Medium
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement a robust synthetic data generation pipeline (FR7) to create diverse training data covering various fonts, degradations, and layouts.
    *   Establish a continuous model evaluation framework using diverse, challenging benchmark datasets.
    *   Invest heavily in fine-tuning models on domain-specific data if particular use cases are prioritized.
    *   Clearly communicate realistic accuracy expectations for different document qualities and types.
    *   Enhance the advanced post-processing module (FR4 - ByT5, simulated quantum correction) to specifically target common error patterns of the chosen OCR models.
    *   Allow users to provide feedback on OCR results to collect data for further model improvement.

## 4. Risk: Dependency Management Complexity

*   **Description:** Managing the complex web of dependencies for Python, machine learning frameworks (PyTorch/TensorFlow for model training/conversion), ONNX, DirectML drivers, OpenCV, and various OCR engine components can lead to version conflicts, installation issues for users, and maintenance overhead.
*   **Likelihood:** High
*   **Impact:** Moderate (Difficult installation process for users, increased development time spent on troubleshooting compatibility issues, potential for difficult-to-reproduce bugs)
*   **Overall Risk Level:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use virtual environments (e.g., venv, Conda) consistently during development.
    *   Pin dependency versions in `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` and regularly test updates in isolated environments.
    *   Create a comprehensive installer (e.g., using MSIX packaging) that bundles necessary runtime dependencies or clearly guides users through their installation.
    *   Minimize the number of core dependencies where possible; evaluate libraries carefully.
    *   Provide detailed troubleshooting guides for common installation and dependency issues.
    *   Consider containerization (e.g., Docker) for development and testing environments to ensure consistency, even if the final product is a native application.

## 5. Risk: Talent Acquisition and Team Expertise Gaps

*   **Description:** The project requires specialized skills in OCR, deep learning (model training, optimization), ONNX, DirectML programming, advanced Python, and Windows application development (.NET or Python with WinUI/PyQt). Difficulty in finding or retaining team members with this combined expertise.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Severe (Slower development progress, lower quality implementation, inability to implement advanced features effectively, project delays)
*   **Overall Risk Level:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Prioritize hiring individuals with a proven track record in relevant areas.
    *   Invest in training and upskilling for existing team members.
    *   Foster a collaborative environment that encourages knowledge sharing.
    *   Engage with external consultants or communities for specific challenging problems.
    *   Clearly define roles and responsibilities to ensure all critical skill areas are covered.
    *   Focus on well-documented, modular components to reduce the learning curve for new team members.
    *   If gaps persist, consider de-scoping or phasing the implementation of the most skill-intensive features.
