# OCR-X Project: Quality Gates (Option B - Flexible Hybrid Powerhouse)

This document outlines the Quality Gates for the OCR-X project (Option B - Flexible Hybrid Powerhouse). These gates are designed to ensure code quality, maintainability, security, and performance throughout the development lifecycle.

## I. Code Review Checklists

*   **Purpose:** To ensure code quality, maintainability, and adherence to standards before merging new code into `main` or release branches. Code reviews foster knowledge sharing and collective code ownership.
*   **General Checklist Items (Applicable to most code contributions):**
    *   **Understandability & Maintainability:**
        *   Code is clear, concise, and easy to understand.
        *   Complex logic is well-commented.
        *   Function and variable names are descriptive and follow project conventions.
        *   Code is organized logically within modules and classes.
        *   "Magic numbers" or unexplained constants are avoided; named constants are used.
    *   **Correctness & Robustness:**
        *   Functionality aligns with the requirements/user story it addresses.
        *   No obvious logic errors, off-by-one errors, or race conditions (if applicable).
        *   Edge cases and potential failure modes are considered and handled.
        *   Error handling is robust, providing informative messages and appropriate recovery or failure.
        *   Input validation is present for function/method parameters and user inputs.
    *   **Testing:**
        *   New functionality is accompanied by comprehensive unit tests.
        *   Unit tests cover success paths, failure paths, and edge cases.
        *   All existing unit tests pass with the new changes.
        *   Test coverage for new/modified code meets project standards (target: >80% line coverage).
        *   Integration tests are considered or added if the change involves interaction between components.
    *   **Coding Standards & Best Practices:**
        *   Adherence to Python PEP 8 style guide.
        *   Code formatting is consistent (enforced by Black/Ruff).
        *   No linters (Flake8/Ruff) warnings/errors.
        *   Dependencies are managed correctly (e.g., updated in `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` with justification).
        *   No large, commented-out blocks of dead code.
        *   Resource management is handled correctly (e.g., closing files, releasing locks).
    *   **Security & Performance:**
        *   No hardcoded sensitive information (API keys, passwords, secrets). Secrets are managed via configuration or secure stores.
        *   Input data is treated as untrusted and sanitized where appropriate (especially if data comes from external sources or user input that could be part of file paths, etc.).
        *   No obvious performance bottlenecks introduced; efficient algorithms and data structures are used where critical.
        *   Logging is sufficient for debugging and monitoring, but avoids logging sensitive data.
    *   **Documentation:**
        *   Docstrings are present for all public modules, classes, functions, and methods, explaining purpose, arguments, and return values.
        *   Complex or non-obvious code sections are adequately commented.
        *   Relevant project documentation (e.g., design documents, READMEs) is updated if the change impacts them.
    *   **Git Hygiene:**
        *   Commit messages are clear and descriptive.
        *   Commits are atomic and represent logical changes.
        *   The pull request (PR) description clearly explains the purpose and scope of the changes.

*   **Module-Specific Checklist Items (Examples):**
    *   **Recognition Module (Abstraction Layer & Engine Wrappers):**
        *   Correct and complete implementation of the common `OCREngine` interface (methods, parameters, return types).
        *   Secure retrieval and handling of API keys/credentials for cloud engine wrappers (e.g., from environment variables or secure configuration, no direct logging of secrets).
        *   Robust parsing of responses from different local and cloud engines into the common internal OCR data format.
        *   Graceful handling of network errors, timeouts, or API-specific exceptions for cloud engines, providing clear error states.
        *   Correct parameter mapping to underlying SDKs or ONNX model execution.
    *   **Windows Client (UI/UX - PyQt6):**
        *   UI elements are responsive and do not freeze during backend operations (proper use of threading for OCR tasks).
        *   Adherence to Windows UI/UX guidelines for a native look-and-feel (if specified by project design).
        *   User inputs are validated (e.g., file paths, configuration settings entered in UI).
        *   Error messages displayed to the user are clear, concise, and user-friendly.
        *   Basic accessibility considerations are met (e.g., keyboard navigation for main features, sufficient color contrast, ARIA attributes if any web-based UI components are used).
        *   Proper cleanup of UI resources (e.g., disconnecting signals, deleting objects if manual memory management is needed in Qt).
    *   **Configuration Manager:**
        *   Secure handling of sensitive configurations, especially API keys (e.g., integration with Windows Credential Manager or OS keychain, or clear guidance on secure environment variable usage).
        *   Robust parsing and validation of configuration files (e.g., handling missing keys, incorrect data types) with sensible defaults or clear error reporting.
        *   Changes to configuration are correctly applied by relevant modules.
    *   **ONNX Model Integration (Preprocessing, Recognition, Post-Processing):**
        *   Correct loading of ONNX models and initialization of `ONNX Runtime` inference sessions.
        *   Proper configuration of execution providers (DirectML, CPU), including fallbacks.
        *   Correct input tensor preparation (shape, data type, normalization) for the specific ONNX model.
        *   Correct parsing of output tensors from the ONNX model.

*   **Process:**
    *   All pull requests (PRs) to the `main` branch or any release branches must be reviewed and approved by at least one other designated team member (preferably two for significant changes).
    *   Reviewers are expected to use the relevant sections of this checklist as a guide.
    *   Automated checks (linters, formatters, unit tests, CI builds) must pass before a review is requested.
    *   Issues, questions, or suggestions identified during the review must be discussed and addressed (either by code changes or satisfactory explanation) by the author before the PR can be merged.
    *   Reviewers should confirm that they have locally pulled the changes and tested critical functionality where appropriate.

## II. Automated Vulnerability Scanning

*   **Purpose:** To proactively identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities in the OCR-X codebase and its third-party dependencies.
*   **Tools & Integration:**
    *   **Python Code Analysis:**
        *   **`Bandit`:** Static analysis tool for finding common security issues in Python code.
            *   **Integration:** Run as part of the CI/CD pipeline on every PR and push to `main`.
            *   **Configuration:** Configured with a baseline to ignore certain non-applicable warnings if necessary, but with a high threshold for new issues.
    *   **Dependency Vulnerability Checking:**
        *   **`Safety`** or **`pip-audit`:** Checks installed Python packages against known vulnerability databases.
            *   **Integration:** Run as part of the CI/CD pipeline after dependency installation.
            *   **Configuration:** Fail the build if vulnerabilities above a certain severity (e.g., MEDIUM or HIGH) are found in dependencies.
    *   **Container Image Scanning (If Docker is used for components/testing/builds):**
        *   **Tools:** `Trivy` (Aqua Security) or `Clair` (Quay).
            *   **Integration:** Integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to scan Docker images after they are built (e.g., images for testing or build environments).
            *   **Configuration:** Scan for both OS package vulnerabilities and language-specific library vulnerabilities within the image. Fail build on high/critical vulnerabilities.
    *   **Secrets Scanning:**
        *   **Tools:** `detect-secrets` (Yelp) or GitHub's native secret scanning capabilities.
            *   **Integration:**
                *   As a pre-commit hook to prevent secrets from being committed locally.
                *   As a step in the CI/CD pipeline to catch any secrets that might have bypassed pre-commit hooks.
            *   **Configuration:** Baseline can be established for known, non-sensitive false positives.
*   **Process:**
    *   **CI/CD Failure:** The CI/CD pipeline will be configured to fail if `Bandit` (for code), `Safety`/`pip-audit` (for dependencies), or container scanners detect vulnerabilities exceeding a predefined severity threshold (e.g., HIGH or CRITICAL).
    *   **Regular Scans:** Schedule regular (e.g., weekly or nightly) full scans of the codebase and dependencies, even if no code changes occur, to catch newly disclosed vulnerabilities.
    *   **Alerts:** Immediate alerts (e.g., Slack notifications, emails) for any secrets detected in commits via GitHub's secret scanning or `detect-secrets` in CI.
    *   **Vulnerability Management:**
        *   A defined process for triaging identified vulnerabilities: assess applicability, severity in the context of OCR-X, and potential impact.
        *   Prioritize remediation based on severity and exploitability.
        *   Track vulnerabilities and their remediation status using an issue tracker (e.g., GitHub Issues).
        *   Regularly update dependencies to their latest secure versions.

## III. Performance Benchmarking & Regression Detection

*   **Purpose:** To ensure OCR-X consistently meets its performance targets (accuracy, speed, resource usage) and to detect and address performance regressions early in the development cycle.
*   **Benchmark Suite:**
    *   A standardized, version-controlled set of documents (derived from the E2E test data and potentially augmented with specific challenging cases) covering:
        *   Various image qualities (clean, noisy, low-contrast).
        *   Different print types and fonts.
        *   Diverse layouts (simple single-column, multi-column, presence of minor graphical elements).
        *   A range of document lengths for batch processing tests.
    *   **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to Measure:**
        *   **Accuracy:** Character Error Rate (CER), Word Error Rate (WER) for the local engine ensemble and for each integrated cloud OCR API.
        *   **Latency:**
            *   Per-page processing time (end-to-end from image input to final text output).
            *   Internal latency for major pipeline stages (Preprocessing, Recognition, Post-Processing).
            *   Specific measurements for local engines (CPU vs. DirectML on reference hardware) and cloud engines (including network RTT and API processing time).
        *   **Throughput:** Pages Per Minute (PPM) for batch processing tasks (local and cloud engines).
        *   **Resource Usage (for local engine processing):**
            *   CPU utilization (peak and average).
            *   GPU utilization (peak and average, specifically DirectML activity).
            *   RAM (Working Set) and VRAM consumption (peak).
*   **Process & Integration:**
    *   **CI/CD Integration (Nightly/On-Demand):**
        *   Run a core benchmark suite (a representative subset of the full benchmark suite) on a dedicated, consistent hardware environment (self-hosted runner if possible, or a specific cloud VM instance type) nightly against the `main` branch.
        *   On Pull Requests, a smaller "smoke test" benchmark could be run if feasible, or performance testing could be triggered manually for significant changes.
        *   **Regression Detection:** Compare KPIs against predefined baseline performance targets (from FR5) and/or the results from the previous successful `main` build.
        *   **Alerting/Failing Build:** Issue warnings if performance metrics degrade by a noticeable margin (e.g., >5-10% increase in latency or CER, or similar drop in throughput). Critical regressions (e.g., >20% degradation) might optionally fail the build or require manual approval.
    *   **Pre-Release Performance Testing:**
        *   Conduct comprehensive performance testing using the full benchmark suite on all supported target hardware configurations (reference CPU, different DirectML-capable GPUs) before each official release.
    *   **Results Tracking & Visualization:**
        *   Log all performance metrics (KPIs, resource usage) to a structured format (e.g., CSV, JSON).
        *   Store and version these results (e.g., as build artifacts, in a dedicated repository, or a simple database).
        *   (Optional, for advanced setups) Visualize performance trends over time using tools like Prometheus/Grafana if a time-series database is set up to ingest the metrics, or simpler plotting libraries like Matplotlib/Seaborn for generating reports.
*   **Tools:**
    *   Custom Python scripts leveraging:
        *   `time.perf_counter()` for granular timing.
        *   `memory-profiler` for Python memory usage.
        *   `pytest-benchmark` for more structured benchmark execution within Pytest.
    *   Accuracy metrics: `ocreval` (Python wrapper or direct CLI), `jiwer`.
    *   System monitoring:
        *   Windows Performance Monitor (`perfmon`) or `psutil` (Python library) for CPU/memory.
        *   Task Manager (for manual GPU monitoring) or GPU-specific command-line tools (`nvidia-smi`, AMD equivalent) scriptable for GPU metrics.
    *   (Optional) Version control for benchmark data (Git LFS) and results.

By implementing these quality gates, OCR-X aims to achieve a high standard of code quality, security, and performance, ensuring a reliable and effective solution for users.
