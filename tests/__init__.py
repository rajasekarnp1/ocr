# This file makes the 'tests' directory a Python package.

# You can add test-specific setup or helper functions here if needed.
# For example:
# import unittest
#
# def
# setUpPackage():
#     print("Setting up test package...")
#
# def
# tearDownPackage():
#     print("Tearing down test package...")

# Or, if you're using pytest, you might have conftest.py files instead or in addition.
