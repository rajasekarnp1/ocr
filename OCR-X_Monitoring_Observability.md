# OCR-X Project: Monitoring & Observability Strategy (Option B - Flexible Hybrid Powerhouse)

This document outlines the Monitoring and Observability strategy for the OCR-X project (Option B: Flexible Hybrid Powerhouse). It details how the application's performance, health, and OCR accuracy will be monitored, considering its hybrid nature involving both local and cloud-based OCR engines.

## I. Goals of Monitoring & Observability

The primary goals for monitoring and observability in OCR-X are:

*   **Proactive Issue Detection:** Identify performance degradations (e.g., increased latency, high resource consumption), high error rates (from local engines or cloud APIs), and other operational issues before they significantly impact the user experience.
*   **Understanding System Behavior:** Gain insights into how the application performs across different hardware configurations (especially for DirectML), document types, and selected OCR engines.
*   **Resource Consumption Analysis:** Monitor CPU, GPU (DirectML), and memory usage to ensure efficient operation and identify potential bottlenecks on user machines.
*   **Gathering Data for Optimization:** Collect performance and accuracy data to guide optimization efforts for both local processing paths and interactions with cloud services.
*   **Facilitating Debugging and Root Cause Analysis (RCA):** Provide detailed logs and metrics to help developers and support personnel quickly diagnose and resolve issues.
*   **Understanding Engine Usage & Performance (with Telemetry):** If/when opt-in telemetry is implemented, gain insights into which OCR engines (local vs. cloud) users prefer and their real-world performance and accuracy characteristics.

## II. Key Metrics to Monitor

Metrics will be collected at different levels and for different purposes.

### A. Application Health & Usage Metrics

These metrics provide an overview of the application's stability and how it's being used.

*   **OCR Transaction Success/Failure Rate:**
    *   Overall rate across all engines.
    *   Per engine: Local Ensemble, Google Cloud Vision API, Azure AI Vision API.
    *   Collected via: Internal application counters (local logs/diagnostics panel), Opt-in telemetry (future).
*   **Error Types & Frequencies:**
    *   Categorized errors:
        *   Input: Invalid file format, corrupted file, password-protected PDF.
        *   Preprocessing: Failure in a specific step (e.g., binarization, geometric correction model error).
        *   Recognition (Local): ONNX model loading error, DirectML/CPU inference error.
        *   Recognition (Cloud):
            *   Authentication errors (invalid API key, permissions).
            *   Quota/Rate limit exceeded errors.
            *   Network errors (timeout, DNS, connectivity).
            *   API-specific errors (e.g., invalid image format for API, region not supported).
        *   Post-Processing: Failure in NLP correction, QUBO solver error.
        *   Output: File saving error.
    *   Collected via: Internal application logging, Opt-in telemetry (future).
*   **Engine Usage Distribution:**
    *   Percentage of OCR tasks processed by the local engine vs. each configured cloud API.
    *   Collected via: Opt-in telemetry (future).
*   **Application Startup Time:**
    *   Time from application launch to UI becoming responsive.
    *   Collected via: Internal logging during startup, Performance tests in Staging/QA.
*   **UI Responsiveness (Qualitative & Targeted):**
    *   While hard to quantify automatically for a desktop app without extensive UI test frameworks, this involves:
        *   Ensuring long OCR tasks run on background threads to prevent UI freeze (covered in development best practices and code reviews).
        *   Targeted performance tests for specific UI actions (e.g., time to load results, time to switch settings).
    *   Collected via: Manual QA, Automated UI tests (if implemented), Performance tests.
*   **Crash Rate:**
    *   Application crashes or unhandled exceptions.
    *   Collected via: Integrated crash reporting (e.g., Sentry - future), Manual user reports, Windows Error Reporting (if enabled by user).

### B. Performance Metrics (per engine where applicable)

These metrics help diagnose performance issues and compare engine efficiencies.

*   **Latency:**
    *   **End-to-end OCR processing time:** From when a user initiates OCR on a document to when results are available/displayed.
    *   **Preprocessing time:** Total time spent in the preprocessing module.
    *   **Recognition time:**
        *   Local DirectML: Time for model inference on GPU.
        *   Local CPU: Time for model inference on CPU.
        *   Cloud API call time: Round-trip time for the API request/response (including network latency and provider's processing time). SDKs often provide ways to measure this.
    *   **Post-processing time:** Total time spent in the post-processing module.
    *   Collected via: Internal application timers (`time.perf_counter()`), Logging of processing stages, Performance tests in Staging/QA, Opt-in telemetry (future).
*   **Throughput:**
    *   Pages Per Minute (PPM) for batch processing tasks (if implemented).
    *   Calculated for local engines (CPU and DirectML) and cloud engines (considering API rate limits).
    *   Collected via: Performance tests in Staging/QA, Opt-in telemetry for batch tasks (future).
*   **Cloud API Specifics:**
    *   **API Call Success/Failure Rate:** Number of successful vs. failed calls to each cloud provider's API.
    *   **API Call Latency:** As reported by the SDKs or measured client-side (excluding local processing around the call).
    *   **Rate Limit Warnings/Errors:** Specific errors indicating that API rate limits have been hit.
    *   Collected via: Internal application logging (parsing SDK responses), Cloud provider dashboards (user's responsibility), Opt-in telemetry (future, for aggregated error patterns).

### C. Resource Utilization (User's Machine - Local Processing)

Monitoring local resource usage helps identify performance bottlenecks and ensure the application is efficient.

*   **CPU Usage:**
    *   Overall system CPU usage during OCR-X operations.
    *   CPU usage specific to the OCR-X process and its child processes (if any).
    *   Collected via: `psutil` library (internal diagnostics), Windows Performance Monitor/Task Manager (user/dev analysis).
*   **GPU Usage (DirectML):**
    *   GPU utilization (engine usage) for DirectML tasks.
    *   GPU memory usage.
    *   Collected via: Windows Task Manager (Performance tab -> GPU), GPU vendor tools (`nvidia-smi`, AMD equivalent), `GPUtil` (for NVIDIA, if applicable), DirectX diagnostic tools (for developers).
*   **System Memory Usage:**
    *   RAM consumed by the OCR-X process (Working Set, Private Bytes).
    *   Collected via: `psutil` library (internal diagnostics), Windows Performance Monitor/Task Manager.
*   **Disk I/O:**
    *   Read/write rates for temporary file operations, model loading (especially at startup).
    *   Collected via: Windows Performance Monitor (user/dev analysis).

### D. OCR Accuracy Metrics

Primarily evaluated in controlled environments or via user feedback.

*   **Character Error Rate (CER) / Word Error Rate (WER):**
    *   Calculated on standard test datasets (e.g., `OCR-X_Testing_Strategy_Pyramid.md` E2E test set) in Staging/QA.
    *   If an opt-in feedback mechanism allows users to submit corrections for misrecognized text on their documents, this could provide real-world accuracy insights (requires careful privacy considerations).
    *   Collected via: Automated tests in Staging/QA, Opt-in user feedback with ground truth (future).
*   **Confidence Score Distribution:**
    *   Distribution of confidence scores reported by different OCR engines (local and cloud).
    *   Helps understand engine certainty and set thresholds for warnings about potentially inaccurate results.
    *   Collected via: Internal application logging/diagnostics, Opt-in telemetry (future).

## III. Logging Strategy

(Refers to and expands upon `OCR-X_Code_Templates_OptionB.md` and `OCR-X_Quality_Gates.md`)

*   **Local Application Logs:**
    *   **Framework:** Python's standard `logging` module.
    *   **Log Levels:** DEBUG (verbose, for development), INFO (key operational events), WARNING (potential issues, recoverable errors), ERROR (significant errors preventing a function/operation), CRITICAL (severe errors leading to application instability/crash). Default level for user installations: INFO.
    *   **Content:** Timestamps (ISO 8601 format), log level, module name (`%(name)s`), function name (`%(funcName)s`), line number (`%(lineno)d`), and a detailed message. Stack traces for all exceptions caught at ERROR or CRITICAL levels.
    *   **Format:** Structured logging (e.g., JSON lines) is preferred for ease of parsing, but human-readable plain text is also acceptable as a default. Example:
        ```
        {"timestamp": "2023-10-27T10:30:15.123Z", "level": "INFO", "module": "ocr_workflow_orchestrator", "funcName": "process_document", "message": "OCR started for file 'example.pdf' using engine 'Local_Ensemble_OCR'"}
        {"timestamp": "2023-10-27T10:30:20.456Z", "level": "ERROR", "module": "recognition_module", "funcName": "GoogleCloudOCREngine.recognize", "message": "API Key for Google Cloud OCR is invalid or expired.", "exception_type": "AuthenticationError", "details": "Google API returned 401"}
        ```
    *   **Storage:** User-accessible log files in the application's data directory (e.g., `%LOCALAPPDATA%\OCR-X\logs` or `Documents\OCR-X\logs`). Implement log rotation (e.g., new file per day, or size-based rotation keeping the last N files) using `logging.handlers.RotatingFileHandler` or `TimedRotatingFileHandler`.
    *   **Sensitive Data:** **Strictly no logging of API keys, document content (PII), or other user secrets.** Use placeholders or indicate the presence/absence of data.

*   **Cloud API Logs (User's Responsibility):**
    *   The application will not attempt to fetch or store logs from the user's cloud provider accounts.
    *   Documentation will guide users on how to access their own logs and monitoring dashboards in Google Cloud Console (Cloud Logging, API Metrics) or Azure Portal (Azure Monitor, Application Insights if configured for their API usage) for the OCR services they utilize with their API keys. This helps them track their own usage, billing, and any API-side errors.

## IV. Monitoring Tools & Implementation (for Option B)

*   **Local Monitoring (Built-in to OCR-X):**
    *   **Diagnostic Panel (UI):** A section in the UI that can display:
        *   Recent processing times per document.
        *   Status of selected OCR engine (e.g., "Local: Ready", "Google API: Key Validated", "Azure API: Key Missing").
        *   Counts of successful/failed OCR operations in the current session.
        *   A button to easily open the local log file directory.
    *   **Windows Performance Monitor / Task Manager:** Users and developers can be guided (via documentation or in-app help) to use these standard Windows tools to observe CPU, GPU (DirectML activity is visible in Task Manager on recent Windows versions), and Memory usage of the `OCR-X.exe` process.
    *   **Python Libraries for Internal Metrics Collection:**
        *   `psutil`: To gather CPU and memory usage for the OCR-X process itself (for the diagnostic panel or detailed logging).
        *   `GPUtil` (or similar, if a cross-GPU solution for DirectML monitoring from Python evolves): For NVIDIA GPU details. DirectML's cross-vendor nature makes direct Python-based GPU monitoring harder than CUDA; rely on Task Manager or vendor tools for now.
*   **Staging/QA Environment Monitoring:**
    *   **Profilers:** Use Python's `cProfile` and `pstats` for detailed performance profiling of specific functions or modules. Visualization tools like `snakeviz` or `gprof2dot` can help analyze `cProfile` output.
    *   **Memory Profilers:** `memory-profiler` to identify memory leaks or high usage areas in Python code.
    *   **Automated Test Scripts:** `pytest` fixtures or custom scripts can wrap test executions with `time.perf_counter()` to log performance metrics for key operations on benchmark datasets. These can be compared against baselines.
    *   **GPU-Z / Vendor Tools:** For detailed GPU analysis on specific staging hardware.

*   **Optional Telemetry (Future Enhancement - Opt-In):**
    *   **Framework:** If implemented, `OpenTelemetry` SDK for Python would be the preferred choice for collecting and exporting anonymized metrics and traces.
    *   **Data Points (Anonymized & Aggregated):**
        *   Application start/stop events.
        *   Selected OCR engine for a task.
        *   Processing time (latency) per stage, per engine.
        *   Error categories and frequencies (without sensitive details).
        *   Hardware class (e.g., CPU cores, RAM amount, GPU type - very coarse and anonymized).
        *   Application version, OS version.
    *   **Backend:** A simple backend (e.g., Prometheus for metrics, Grafana for dashboards, or a custom endpoint writing to a time-series database) would be needed to receive and aggregate this data.
    *   **Privacy:** Strict adherence to privacy principles. Users must explicitly opt-in. All data must be anonymized, and no PII or document content ever transmitted. The scope and nature of telemetry data would be clearly documented.

## V. Alerting (Primarily for Development/QA & Guiding Users)

*   **CI/CD Pipeline Alerts:** (As defined in `OCR-X_Quality_Gates.md`)
    *   Performance regression detected on benchmark tests (e.g., >10% slowdown on key metric).
    *   High error rate on accuracy benchmark tests.
    *   Failures in automated vulnerability scans.
    *   Build failures.
    *   Notifications via email or team chat (Slack/Teams) to the development team.
*   **Application Alerts (to User - via UI):**
    *   **Invalid/Missing API Key:** "API Key for [Google/Azure] is missing or invalid. Please check your settings."
    *   **Cloud API Authentication Failure:** "Authentication failed with [Google/Azure] OCR service. Please verify your API key and account status."
    *   **Cloud API Quota/Rate Limit:** "Cloud OCR service [Google/Azure] reported a usage limit error. Please check your quota or try again later."
    *   **Network Failure for Cloud Calls:** "Could not connect to [Google/Azure] OCR service. Please check your internet connection and firewall settings."
    *   **Local Model Loading Failure:** "Failed to load local OCR model: [model_name]. The application might need reinstallation or repair."
    *   **File Processing Error:** "Error processing file [filename]: [brief error description, e.g., unsupported format, corrupted]."
    *   **Low Confidence Warning:** "OCR results for this document have low confidence. Accuracy may be poor." (With an option to proceed or cancel).
    *   **Insufficient Resources:** "Low system memory or GPU resources detected. OCR performance may be affected or fail." (If detectable proactively).

This Monitoring and Observability strategy aims to provide the necessary insights for maintaining a high-quality, reliable, and performant OCR-X application. It balances built-in capabilities with guidance for users and more detailed analysis for development and QA.The `OCR-X_Monitoring_Observability.md` file has been created successfully.
