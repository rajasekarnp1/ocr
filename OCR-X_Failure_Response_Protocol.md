# OCR-X Project: Failure Response Protocol (Option B - Flexible Hybrid Powerhouse)

This document details the procedures for handling various types of failures within the OCR-X project (Option B: Flexible Hybrid Powerhouse).

## I. Overview and Goals

*   **Goals:**
    *   **Minimize Downtime/Impact:** Ensure that any failure has the least possible impact on users.
    *   **Rapid Recovery:** Restore full functionality as quickly as possible.
    *   **Prevent Recurrence:** Understand the root cause of failures and implement measures to prevent them from happening again.
    *   **Learn from Incidents:** Continuously improve the system and processes based on insights gained from failures.
*   **Emphasis:** This protocol emphasizes a structured and systematic approach to failure detection, analysis, resolution, and learning to build a resilient and reliable OCR application.

## II. Failure Detection and Alerting

*   **Monitoring Systems:**
    *   **Application Logging:** Comprehensive logging across all modules (Orchestrator, Preprocessing, Recognition, Post-Processing, UI) as detailed in `OCR-X_Code_Templates_OptionB.md`. Logs will capture errors, warnings, and critical operational information. Log levels will be configurable.
    *   **Windows Performance Monitor:** For system-level metrics (CPU, RAM usage) on the client machine, which can indicate performance degradation or resource exhaustion caused by OCR-X. (Referenced from `OCR-X_Development_Environment.md` and `OCR-X_Quality_Gates.md`).
    *   **GPU-Specific Monitoring Tools:** Tools like `nvidia-smi` (for NVIDIA) or AMD equivalents will be used during development and recommended for advanced users to monitor GPU performance and DirectML health if issues are suspected.
    *   **Cloud API Monitoring Dashboards:** For cloud-connected features (Google Document AI, Azure AI Vision), leverage the monitoring dashboards provided by Google Cloud Platform and Microsoft Azure to track API error rates, latency, and usage quotas.
    *   **(Future Consideration - Prometheus/Grafana):** If OCR-X evolves to include server-side components or more extensive telemetry, Prometheus for metrics collection and Grafana for visualization would be considered (as noted in `OCR-X_Quality_Gates.md`).
    *   **Key Metrics Triggering Alerts (Conceptual - primarily for development/support team initially):**
        *   **High OCR Error Rates:** Significant increase in Character Error Rate (CER) / Word Error Rate (WER) from local or cloud engines on benchmark/canary inputs.
        *   **API Client Errors:** Sustained high rate of authentication failures, rate limit exceeded errors, or other HTTP error codes (4xx, 5xx) from commercial cloud OCR APIs.
        *   **High Processing Latency:** Average per-page processing time exceeding predefined thresholds for local (CPU/DirectML) or cloud engines.
        *   **Excessive Resource Usage:** Application consistently consuming CPU or RAM above expected baselines, or VRAM exhaustion for DirectML tasks.
        *   **Application Crashes/Unhandled Exceptions:** Tracked through logging and potentially an integrated crash reporting mechanism (e.g., Sentry, or manual collection during beta).
        *   **Engine Switching Failures:** Inability of the OCR Engine Abstraction Layer to switch to a selected or fallback engine.

*   **Alerting Mechanisms:**
    *   **Development/QA Phase:**
        *   CI/CD pipeline failures (e.g., if automated tests or benchmark checks fail).
        *   Logging to files and console for developers.
        *   Manual monitoring of cloud provider dashboards.
    *   **Post-Release/Production (Conceptual - depends on support model):**
        *   **Email Notifications:** For critical alerts (e.g., widespread API failures detected through any backend health checks, high crash report rates) to a designated support/dev team alias.
        *   **Slack/Microsoft Teams:** For medium to high severity alerts, integrated via webhooks from monitoring systems or CI/CD.
        *   **(Future) PagerDuty/Opsgenie:** For S1 critical incidents requiring immediate out-of-hours attention if a formal operational support model is established.

*   **User-Reported Issues:**
    *   **Integrated Feedback Mechanism:** The Windows client application should include a user-friendly way to report issues (e.g., a "Report a Bug" menu option). This could:
        *   Pre-fill relevant system information (OS version, app version, selected OCR engine).
        *   Allow users to describe the problem and (optionally) attach problematic files or anonymized snippets.
        *   Offer to include recent (non-sensitive) application logs.
    *   **Support Email:** A dedicated support email address (e.g., `ocrx-support@example.com`).
    *   **GitHub Issues (If any part is open-source or uses GitHub for community interaction):** Users can report bugs, request features, and provide feedback directly.

## III. Incident Triage and Prioritization

*   **Initial Assessment:**
    *   **Gather Information:** Collect initial details from the alert or user report (error messages, screenshots, steps to reproduce, system environment).
    *   **Reproducibility:** Attempt to reproduce the issue on a test environment.
    *   **Scope:**
        *   Number of users affected (e.g., single user, group of users, all users).
        *   Impact on functionality (e.g., specific feature, core OCR pipeline, entire application).
        *   Which OCR engine(s) are affected (local, specific cloud provider, all).
        *   Specific document types, input methods, or configurations affected.
    *   **Severity Determination:** Assign a severity level based on impact and urgency.

*   **Severity Levels (Example):**
    *   **Critical (S1):**
        *   Application is unusable for a majority of users (e.g., frequent crashes on startup or during core operations).
        *   Core OCR functionality is broken for all engines (e.g., no text output, consistently garbage output).
        *   Data corruption or loss (e.g., user configurations, though less likely for OCR-X's primary function).
        *   Critical security vulnerability identified.
        *   **Response Target:** Immediate attention, aim for workaround/hotfix within hours.
    *   **High (S2):**
        *   Major functionality is significantly impaired or unavailable for many users.
        *   One of the primary OCR engines (e.g., default local ensemble or a key cloud API) is consistently failing or producing very poor results.
        *   Significantly degraded performance making the application very difficult to use.
        *   **Response Target:** Address within 1-2 business days, workaround if possible sooner.
    *   **Medium (S3):**
        *   Minor functionality is impaired, or a major feature has issues for a limited set of users or specific scenarios.
        *   Issues with specific, less common document types, fonts, or layouts.
        *   UI glitches or non-critical usability issues.
        *   One of the non-default OCR engines is misbehaving.
        *   **Response Target:** Address in the next planned sprint or minor release.
    *   **Low (S4):**
        *   Cosmetic issues, typos in UI/documentation, minor deviations from expected behavior with minimal user impact.
        *   Requests for minor enhancements or clarifications.
        *   **Response Target:** Address when resources permit, or backlog for future consideration.

*   **Prioritization:**
    *   Incidents are prioritized based on their severity level and scope.
    *   S1 incidents require an "all hands on deck" approach until a workaround or fix is in place.
    *   S2 incidents are typically the next highest priority for the development team.
    *   S3 and S4 issues are scheduled into sprints based on available capacity and overall product roadmap.
    *   A designated person or small team (e.g., lead developer, product owner) is responsible for final prioritization if conflicts arise.

## IV. Root Cause Analysis (RCA) Methodology

*   **Techniques:**
    *   **The 5 Whys:** Iteratively ask "Why?" to drill down from the symptom to the underlying root cause. Useful for simpler issues.
    *   **Log Analysis:**
        *   **Application Logs:** Examine OCR-X's own logs (from all relevant modules) for error messages, stack traces, and operational context around the time of failure. Correlate timestamps.
        *   **System Logs:** Check Windows Event Viewer (Application, System, Security logs) for relevant system-level errors.
        *   **DirectML Debug Layers/Logs:** If DirectML issues are suspected, enable DirectML debug layers (during development/testing) or check for any specific logs/events it might generate.
        *   **Cloud API Logs:** If using cloud engines, check the logging and monitoring sections of Google Cloud Console or Azure Portal for the specific API calls (status codes, error messages, request/response payloads if available and logging is enabled).
    *   **Correlation with Recent Changes:**
        *   Review recent code commits and merges (Git history).
        *   Check for recent application deployments or updates.
        *   Identify any recent changes to configuration files (application, OS, drivers).
        *   Note any recent updates to third-party libraries or dependencies.
    *   **Reproducibility:** Systematically attempt to reproduce the failure in a controlled test or staging environment. This is key to confirming the cause and testing fixes. Vary inputs, configurations, and environmental factors.
    *   **Component Isolation:**
        *   If the failure seems to occur within the OCR pipeline, try to isolate which stage (Preprocessing, specific Recognition Engine, Post-Processing) is failing.
        *   Use the engine switching mechanism: if one engine fails, does another work? This helps isolate engine-specific vs. general pipeline issues.
        *   Bypass optional steps (e.g., specific preprocessing filters, advanced post-processing) to see if the issue resolves.
    *   **Differential Diagnosis:** Compare failing scenarios with known working scenarios to identify key differences.
    *   **Code Inspection:** Detailed review of the suspected code paths.

*   **Documentation:**
    *   All S1 and S2 incidents (and S3 if deemed significant) require a documented RCA.
    *   This is typically recorded in the issue tracking system (e.g., GitHub Issue, Jira ticket) associated with the bug.
    *   The RCA document should include:
        *   Incident summary (what happened, when, impact).
        *   Timeline of events.
        *   Root cause(s) identified.
        *   Fix implemented (if any).
        *   Action items to prevent recurrence.

## V. Quick Fix vs. Sustainable Solution Decision Framework

*   **Criteria for Quick Fix (Hotfix/Patch):**
    *   The incident is of Critical (S1) or High (S2) severity, causing significant user impact and requiring immediate service restoration or mitigation.
    *   A clear, well-understood, low-risk fix is available that directly addresses the symptoms.
    *   Implementing a full, sustainable solution would take considerably longer, leaving users impacted.
    *   The quick fix does not introduce major new risks or significant technical debt that cannot be managed.
*   **Criteria for Sustainable Solution:**
    *   The root cause of the issue has been thoroughly analyzed and understood.
    *   The quick fix (if applied) has known limitations, introduces unacceptable technical debt, or carries a risk of side effects.
    *   The problem is likely to recur if only a superficial fix is applied.
    *   The sustainable solution provides long-term stability and addresses the underlying problem.
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Assess Severity & Impact:** Determine if a quick fix is warranted.
    2.  **Identify Quick Fix:** If so, identify the simplest, safest way to mitigate the immediate impact (e.g., reverting a specific commit, disabling a problematic feature via configuration, patching a specific function).
    3.  **Test Quick Fix:** Rigorously test the quick fix in a staging environment to ensure it resolves the symptom and doesn't introduce new critical issues.
    4.  **Deploy Quick Fix:** Roll out the quick fix to affected users.
    5.  **Plan Sustainable Solution:** **Crucially, always create a follow-up task or ticket to develop and deploy a sustainable solution.** This task should be prioritized appropriately. The quick fix is a temporary measure.
    6.  **Track Technical Debt:** If the quick fix introduces technical debt, document it and schedule its resolution.

## VI. Rollback Procedures

*   **Application Version Rollback (Windows Client - MSIX):**
    *   **MSIX Capabilities:** If OCR-X is packaged as an MSIX, Windows provides mechanisms for users to revert to a previously installed version if the new version causes critical issues (assuming the older package is still available on the user's system or through the distribution channel).
    *   **Manual Rollback (Developer/Support Guided):**
        1.  Instruct users to uninstall the problematic version of OCR-X via Windows Settings ("Apps & features").
        2.  Provide access to the installer package (`.msix`, `.appinstaller`) of the last known stable version.
        3.  Guide users through reinstalling the stable version.
        4.  Ensure user configurations are compatible or can be managed during rollback/reinstall.
*   **Model Rollback (Local Engines - ONNX):**
    *   **Versioning:** Maintain a versioned repository of all ONNX models used by local engines (as per `OCR-X_Component_Breakdown_OptionB.md` and `OCR-X_Technology_Selection_OptionB.md` suggesting Git LFS).
    *   **Procedure:**
        1.  Identify the problematic model version.
        2.  Update the application's configuration (e.g., in `config.yaml` or managed by the Configuration Manager) to point to the file path of the last known stable version of the ONNX model.
        3.  Restart the OCR-X application. The application should then load the specified older model version on initialization.
        4.  (Advanced) If models are bundled within the MSIX package, a full application rollback might be needed unless an out-of-band model update mechanism is implemented (which adds complexity).
*   **Configuration Rollback:**
    *   **Backup:** Encourage users (or the application itself, if feasible) to back up configuration files (e.g., `config.yaml`, API key storage if managed in files) before making significant changes or updates.
    *   **Version Control (for default/template configs):** Default or template configuration files shipped with the application should be under version control in the source repository.
    *   **Manual Revert:** If a configuration change causes issues, users can revert to a previous version of their configuration file from their backup, or developers can provide a known good default configuration.
*   **Cloud API Engine Issues (Built-in Resilience):**
    *   The "Flexible Hybrid Powerhouse" architecture inherently provides a rollback/failover mechanism.
    *   **Procedure:**
        1.  If a specific commercial cloud API (e.g., Google Document AI) starts failing or producing poor results:
            *   The user can manually switch to an alternative engine (another configured cloud API like Azure, or the local ONNX ensemble) via the Windows client UI.
            *   (Future Enhancement) The system could be designed to automatically detect sustained failures from a selected cloud API and temporarily switch to a pre-configured fallback engine, notifying the user.
*   **Data Consistency:**
    *   OCR-X is primarily a processing tool, so complex transactional data consistency issues are less likely compared to database-centric applications.
    *   **User Configurations:** Ensure that any changes to user configurations (e.g., API keys, engine preferences) are saved atomically or that backups of previous configurations are maintained if possible, to prevent corruption.
    *   **Batch Processing State (If Implemented):** If a future version includes long-running batch processing with persistent state, ensure that operations are idempotent or that state can be safely rolled back or recovered in case of interruption or failure during the batch. This is not a primary concern for the initial client-focused version.

## VII. Post-Incident Review & Learning

*   **Process:**
    *   For all Critical (S1) and High (S2) severity incidents, a **blameless post-mortem review** will be conducted within one week of incident resolution.
    *   Medium (S3) incidents may also warrant a post-mortem if they are recurring or reveal significant underlying issues.
    *   The review team should include developers involved in the incident, QA/testers, and potentially a product owner or representative.
*   **Goals of Post-Mortem:**
    *   **What happened?** (Factual timeline of events, from detection to resolution).
    *   **What was the impact?** (Scope, duration, user experience, data affected if any).
    *   **Why did it happen?** (Detailed root cause analysis, going beyond superficial causes).
    *   **What went well during the response?** (Effective communication, quick diagnosis, successful workarounds).
    *   **What could have been done better?** (Gaps in monitoring, slow diagnosis, communication issues, missing documentation).
    *   **Follow-up Actions:** Specific, actionable, assigned, and time-bound tasks to:
        *   Fix underlying bugs or design flaws.
        *   Improve monitoring and alerting.
        *   Enhance documentation or runbooks.
        *   Update testing procedures or add new test cases.
        *   Prevent similar incidents from recurring.
*   **Documentation:**
    *   A summary of the post-mortem (including timeline, root cause, impact, and action items) will be documented and shared with the relevant team members.
    *   This documentation will be stored in a central knowledge base (e.g., project wiki, Confluence, shared document repository).
    *   Update existing documentation (e.g., troubleshooting guides, operational runbooks, `OCR-X_Risk_Assessment.md`) based on lessons learned.
    *   Track follow-up action items in the project's issue tracker until completion.

This Failure Response Protocol aims to create a resilient OCR-X application and a development process that learns and improves from every incident.The `OCR-X_Failure_Response_Protocol.md` file has been created successfully.
