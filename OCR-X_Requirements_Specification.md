# OCR-X Project: SMART Requirements Specification

This document outlines the SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) requirements for the OCR-X project, derived from User Personas, Success Metrics, Competitive Analysis, and Feature Gap Analysis.

## I. Functional Requirements

### FR1: Core OCR Accuracy (Machine Print)

*   **Specific:** The system shall achieve a Character Error Rate (CER) below 0.5% and Word Error Rate (WER) below 1.0% on standard machine-printed text benchmarks (e.g., ICDAR 2019, a curated internal test set of diverse documents). It must effectively handle common fonts (e.g., Times New Roman, Arial, Calibri, Courier, Helvetica) and sizes down to 6pt. The system must also demonstrate robustness against common document image distortions like mild blur and illumination changes.
*   **Measurable:** CER and WER measured using standard tools like `ocreval` for character-level and `jiwer` for word-level accuracy on the defined test sets. Font, size, and distortion handling verified via specific, challenging test cases included in the internal test set.
*   **Achievable:** Based on leveraging and potentially ensembling local State-of-the-Art (SOTA) open-source models (e.g., inspired by PP-OCRv4, SVTR, or newer transformer-based architectures), **and/or utilizing leading commercial cloud OCR APIs (such as Google Document AI or Azure AI Vision)**, complemented by advanced pre/post-processing techniques. The specified accuracy targets are ambitious but reflect the project's goal to be competitive and are well within the capabilities of these approaches.
*   **Relevant:** Addresses the primary user need for highly accurate and reliable text extraction from machine-printed documents, as highlighted in all user personas and the feature gap analysis.
*   **Time-bound:**
    *   **MVP Target:** CER < 1.0%, WER < 2.0% on primary benchmarks for English.
    *   **v1.0 Target:** CER < 0.5%, WER < 1.0% on primary benchmarks for English. Handling of specified fonts and 6pt size.

### FR2: Advanced Preprocessing Module

*   **Specific:** The system shall include an adaptive preprocessing module capable of automatic binarization (e.g., U-Net based or Sauvola/Niblack with automatic parameter tuning), noise reduction (e.g., learned filters or advanced non-local means), and geometric correction (e.g., DeepXY based or RARE-like Thin-Plate Spline transformation for perspective/distortion) for scanned documents and camera captures.
*   **Measurable:**
    *   OCR accuracy improvement (CER reduction of at least 15-20%) on a standardized noisy/distorted document set (e.g., DocUNet benchmark, or custom set with synthetic distortions) when the preprocessing module is enabled, compared to baseline (e.g., simple Otsu binarization, no geometric correction).
    *   Geometric correction accuracy: average angle error reduction to within 0.5 degrees for skew and a measurable improvement in perspective distortion metrics (e.g., Intersection over Union of key document regions after correction).
*   **Achievable:** Implementations based on existing research papers and open-source libraries (OpenCV, Scikit-image, TensorFlow/PyTorch for deep learning models). U-Net for binarization and transformer-based networks for geometric correction are well-documented.
*   **Relevant:** Directly addresses critical feature gaps related to poor input quality (degraded/noisy documents, distortions) identified in user feedback and competitive analysis.
*   **Time-bound:**
    *   **MVP:** Core binarization (Sauvola/Niblack) and basic noise reduction (Gaussian/median filters).
    *   **v1.0:** Adaptive binarization, advanced noise reduction, and basic geometric correction (skew).
    *   **v1.1:** Advanced geometric correction (perspective/distortion).

### FR3: Hybrid Recognition Engine

*   **Specific:** The system shall utilize a hybrid recognition architecture, potentially an ensemble of diverse SOTA models (e.g., combining a transformer-based recognizer like TrOCR or SVTR with a CRNN-based model like PP-OCRv4's recognizer) or a dynamic model selection mechanism based on input characteristics (e.g., detected script, image quality, presence of tables).
*   **Measurable:** Accuracy improvement (CER reduction of at least 3-5%) on a challenging, mixed-quality document benchmark (containing varied fonts, noise levels, and simple layouts) compared to using the best single constituent SOTA model within the ensemble.
*   **Achievable:** Research and implement model fusion techniques (e.g., weighted averaging of confidence scores, voting) or develop a lightweight classifier for dynamic model selection. This requires careful model selection and engineering.
*   **Relevant:** Aims to provide robustness and higher overall accuracy across a wider variety of inputs and edge cases, a common pain point identified in the feature gap analysis.
*   **Time-bound:**
    *   **MVP:** Focus on a single, highly robust SOTA model.

*   **Achievable:** Integrate pre-trained models from HuggingFace Transformers (ByT5/T5) and fine-tune on OCR-specific datasets. Implement Qiskit or similar quantum simulation libraries for the PoC. The quantum aspect is exploratory.
*   **Relevant:** Addresses the user need for the highest possible accuracy by correcting errors beyond the raw output of the OCR models, a key differentiator.
*   **Time-bound:**
    *   **v1.0:** NLP-based error correction (e.g., ByT5) integrated.
    *   **v1.1 / Post v1.0:** Quantum-inspired error correction PoC developed and evaluated.

CPU-only speed target: 5-10 PPM on a modern quad-core CPU. Processing speed and latency for **cloud-based engines** will also be benchmarked and documented, considering API call overheads and typical network conditions.
    *   UI responsiveness: key interactions (e.g., opening file, starting OCR, displaying results) completed within 1-2 seconds.

Secure authentication (e.g., user-provided API keys, OAuth2 tokens managed by the application where appropriate) must be implemented for accessing cloud services. The application must provide mechanisms for secure storage and handling of these credentials (e.g., leveraging Windows Credential Manager or similar secure storage). Basic protection against OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities relevant to a desktop client interacting with web services should be considered. No storage of user document content by OCR-X beyond local processing unless explicitly agreed by the user for specific features (e.g., caching, error reporting with consent).

*   **CSO1: Windows 11 Integration & Performance:**
    *   **Specific:** Ensure the OCR-X Windows application has a native look-and-feel consistent with Windows 11 design principles (e.g., Mica material if appropriate, updated iconography). Optimize performance specifically using the latest DirectML advancements and Windows 11 scheduler improvements if applicable. Ensure compatibility with Windows 11 APIs and security features (e.g., MSIX packaging).
    *   **Measurable:** Visual consistency verified against Windows 11 UI guidelines. Performance benchmarks (PPM, latency) specifically on Windows 11 machines, aiming for a 5-10% improvement over Windows 10 if specific optimizations are leveraged. Successful MSIX packaging and deployment.
